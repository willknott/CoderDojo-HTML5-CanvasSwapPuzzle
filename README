Tutorial on doing a HTML5 image swapping puzzle (similar to a sliding 
puzzle) for Coder Dojo Cork beginning 2012-02-18 for 4 weeks.

Covered...
Loops For 
Logic (or, and & not gates)
Arrays
Objects
Mouse interaction
Canvas

If you are reading along, read the pdf/ppt/txt files for the 
comments and documentation of the code.

And yes, the shuffle barely works, but the simple reverse was used 
to just jumble the initial picture. 
Proper shuffleing will be covered later.
